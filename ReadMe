There are 2 accounts already made which you can log into, you can view the SavingsFile.txt or General Investment CertificateFile.txt

To create an account, simply press "Create an Account" button on the UILogin and it will direct you to
a new window where you need to enter all your info and once that is done you will be directed to the 
transaction window where you can deposit and withdraw amounts.
